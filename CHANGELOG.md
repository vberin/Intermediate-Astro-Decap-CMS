### Minor changes

- The `tags` array of strings in the blog config is now a `isFeatured` boolean.

## 2.2.2

### Minor changes

- Support for local_backend in decap config has been removed due to 1. irrelevancy 2.causing bugs

```

## 2.1.0

### Major changes

The blog has received new components and some refactoring.

- Refactored `blog/index.astro`, `blog/[...slug].astro` and `blog.less` to separate concerns, increase readability and reusability.
  - New layouts in `src/layouts`
    - BlogPostLayout is used to wrap an individual blog post in `src/blog/[...slug].astro`
    - `BlogRecentArticles.astro` and `BlogRecentArticlesWithSidebar` are used to wrap recent articles with or without a sidebar widget, and are used in `src/blog/index.astro`
    - Their respective styles are moved from `blog.less` and now scoped to the layout for increased readability and maintainability
  - `blog.less` has been removed
  - `markdown.less` has been created and holds all the styles for markdown content
  - `sidebar.less` has been created and holds the styles for the sidebar widgets, shared across mutiple components.
  - New component: TableOfContents.astro. Is used in a sidebar on the individual posts and allows easy navigation within the article.
- Baselayout now has typed Props and uses an optional preloadedImage prop consumed by: 1. the preload link and 2. the og tags for social sharing.
  For example, the cover image on a blog page passed to Baselayout will be used as the social image
- Removed getOptimizedImage() from @utils and replaced with getImage() function directly in the page
- Created new demo post `images-in-markdown-posts.md` to illustrate using remote and local images in markdown content.

## 2.0.0

### Major changes

- Astro has been upgraded to v5.0

#### What should I do on my fork?

1.  **Upgrade Astro and its dependencies** 1. Run `npx @astrojs/upgrade` in your terminal 2. At the yellow warning, choose ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to continue
    <br>

2.  **Breaking change: Renamed: <ViewTransitions /> component**
    <br> üì¢ Reference: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#renamed-viewtransitions--component 1. In `BaseLayout.astro`, replace all occurrences of the¬†`ViewTransitions`¬†import and component with¬†`ClientRouter`

            ```tsx
            // BaseLayout.astro
            - import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
            + import { ClientRouter } from 'astro:transitions';

            <html>
              <head>
                ...
               - <ViewTransitions />
               + <ClientRouter />
              </head>
            </html>
            ```

     <br>

3.  **Breaking Change: Content Collections**
    <br> üì¢ Reference: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#updating-existing-collections 1. **Move the content config file**. This file no longer lives within the¬†`src/content/`¬†folder. This file should now exist at¬†`src/content.config.ts`.

        2. **Edit the collection definition**. Your updated collection requires a¬†`loader`¬†which indicates both a folder for the location of your collection (`base`) and a¬†`pattern`¬†defining the collection entry filenames and extensions to match.


            ```tsx
            // src/content.config.ts

             + import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

            // type: 'content',

            loader: glob({ pattern: '**/[^_]*.{md,mdx}', base: "./src/content/blog" }),

            ```

        3. **Change references from¬†`slug`¬†to¬†`id`**. Content layer collections do not have a reserved¬†`slug`¬†field. Instead, all updated collections will have an¬†`id`.

            For example:

            ```tsx
            // src/pages/blog/[...post].astro

            export async function getStaticPaths() {
              const posts = await getCollection("blog");
              return posts.map((entry) => ({
                // params: { post: entry.slug },
                params: { post: entry.id },
                props: { post: entry },
              }));
            }
            ```

            > üì¢ `CTRL+SHIFT+F` and check for any traces of `.slug`. There shouldn‚Äôt be any more.


        4. **Switch to the new¬†`render()`¬†function**. Entries no longer have a¬†`render()`¬†method. Instead, import the¬†`render()`¬†function from¬†`astro:content`.


            ```tsx
            // src/pages/blog/[...post].astro

            import { getCollection, render } from 'astro:content';

            const { Content } = await page.render();
            const { Content } = await render(post);
            ```

            > üì¢ Running into `Module '"astro:content"' has no exported member 'render'`?
            > => Restart the dev server



        5. Repeat for every content collection you may have added.

4.  **Breaking change: TypeScript configuration**
    <br> üì¢ Reference: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#changed-typescript-configuration 1. Add the following¬†`include`¬†and¬†`exclude`¬†properties to your existing¬†`tsconfig.json`:

    ````
    {
    "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/base",
    "include": [".astro/types.d.ts", "**/*"],
    "exclude": ["dist"]
    }

        ```
    ````

- Ensure that the other packages you may have added are up-to-date and compatible with Astro v5
- Please refer to the [official Upgrade to v5 guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/) if you run into any issues.
